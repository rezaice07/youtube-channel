Starting Up an Oracle Database Instance
##############################################################################
01. Shutdown
	-let's shutdown the instance
	SQL> shutdown immediate
	Database closed.
	Database dismounted.
	ORACLE instance shut down.

02. No Mount
    -restart instance on nomount stage
	SQL> startup nomount
	ORACLE instance started.

	Total System Global Area 4294963272 bytes
	Fixed Size                  8904776 bytes
	Variable Size            2365587456 bytes
	Database Buffers         1912602624 bytes
	Redo Buffers                7868416 bytes

    -Let's see the status for instance
	SQL> select status from v$instance;

	STATUS
	------------
	STARTED
	
	Note: When database is in nomount, 
		=> our database instance is created by reading the spfile file.
		=> Allocating the SGA
		=> Starting the backgound Processes
		=>Opening the alert<SID>.ora and the trace file
	
03. Mount

	-Now we will mount
	SQL> alter database mount;

	Database altered.
	
	Note: Mounting a database includes the following...
	=>Associating a database with a previous started instance
	=>Locating and opening all the control files speficied in the parameter file
	=>Reading the control files to obtain the names and statuses of the data files and online redo log files.
	=>Allows to perform specific maintenance operations...
		a) Renaming data files.
		b) Enabling and Disabling online redo logc) 
		c) Performing Full database backup
		
	-Let's see the status for instance
	SQL> select status from v$instance;

	STATUS
	------------
	MOUNTED
	
	

	
04. Open
	-Let's open the database instance
	
	SQL> alter database open;

	Database altered.

	-Now check the status of database Instance
	
	SQL> select status from v$instance;

	STATUS
	------------
	OPEN
	
	
	SQL> select OPEN_MODE,LOG_MODE from v$database;

	OPEN_MODE            LOG_MODE
	-------------------- ------------
	READ WRITE           NOARCHIVELOG

	
	Note: Opening the database includes the following:
		=> A normal database operation means that an instance is started and the database is mounted and opened. 
	    
		=> Any valid user can connect to the database and perform typical data access operations.
	
		=> Opening the data files
		
		=> Opening the online redo log files
		
		=> If any of the data files or online redo log files are not present when you attempt to open the
		   database, the Oracle server returns an error.
		
		=> During this final stage, the Oracle server verifies that all data files and online redo log files can
		   be opened, and checks the consistency of the database. 
		
		=> If necessary, the System Monitor	(SMON) background process initiates instance recovery.
		
		=> You can start up a database instance in restricted mode so that only Oracle Database users
		   with the RESTRICTED SESSION system privilege can connect to the database.

	More Example:
	If you want to database in read only then execute the command in mounting phase. But to do this you must 
	restart at mount mode the database instance first. let's see...
	
	SQL> alter database open read only;
	alter database open read only
	*
	ERROR at line 1:
	ORA-01531: a database already open by the instance
	
	-So we need to go at mounting phase. To do this we need to shutdown then startup
	SQL> shutdown immediate
	
	SQL> startup mount
	ORACLE instance started.
