Oracle - Managing the Database Instance Shutting Down
---------------------------------------------------
- Shutdown modes:
	• A = ABORT
	• I = IMMEDIATE
	• T = TRANSACTIONAL
	• N = NORMAL
	
	-A = ABORT:
		=>Performs the least amount of work before shutting down
		
		=>Only down the instance but not database
		
		=>No checkpoint happens
		
		=>No new connection allowed.
		
		=>Not waiting until current session end
		
		=>Not waiting until current transctions end
				
		=>Requires recovery before startup by SMON,
		  this is because if there any transctions those are not writen to datafile.
		  
		=>Database and redo buffers are not written to disk.
		
		=>Uncommitted transactions are not rolled back.
		
		=>The instance is terminated without closing the files.
		
		=>The database is not closed or dismounted.
	    
		=>you need to shut down immediately because of an impending situation 
		  such as notice of a power outage within seconds, earthquake, firesituation.
		  
	-LET'S DONW THE DATABASE
	
	-create user a
	SQL> create user a identified by a;

	User created.

	SQL> grant create session to a;

	Grant succeeded.

	-conn a
	SQL> conn a/a
	Connected.
	SQL> select *from user_tables;

	-shutdown abort
	SQL> shutdown abort
	ORACLE instance shut down.
	
	-Now try to execute any query
	SQL> SELECT *FROM USER_TABLES;
	SELECT *FROM USER_TABLES
				 *
	ERROR at line 1:
	ORA-03135: connection lost contact
	Process ID: 8274
	Session ID: 288 Serial number: 13365		
	
	• N = NORMAL:
		A normal database shutdown proceeds with the following conditions:

		• No new connections can be made.

		• The Oracle server waits for all users to disconnect before completing the shutdown.

		• Database and redo buffers are written to disk.

		• Background processes are terminated and the SGA is removed from memory.

		• The Oracle server closes and dismounts the database before shutting down the instance.

		• The next startup does not require an instance recovery.
		
	To expain the normal shutdown, let's follow the below example...
	-Open the Tracing 
	[oracle@dba167 ~]$ tail -200f /u01/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/dba167/dba167/trace/alert_dba167.log

	-connect user a
	SQL> conn a/a
	Connected.
	SQL> show user
	USER is "A"
	
	-shutdown
	SQL> shutdown

	Note: Shutdown is in progress, This is because user session exist for user a
	
	-If we try to connect a new session by a user it will show below messages..
	SQL> conn b/b
	ERROR:
	ORA-01090: shutdown in progress - connection is not                                                                                        permitted
	Process ID: 0
	Session ID: 0 Serial number: 0


	Warning: You are no longer connected to ORACLE.

	
	-Disconnect user a
	SQL> disconn
	Disconnected from Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production
	Version 19.3.0.0.0
	
	-Then we will see the trace file logs for shutting down status and also in shutdown progress status..
	SQL> shutdown
	Database closed.
	Database dismounted.
	ORACLE instance shut down.
	
	• I = IMMEDIATE:
		A shutdown in IMMEDIATE mode proceeds with the following conditions:
		• Current SQL statements being processed by the Oracle database are not completed.
		
		• The Oracle server does not wait for the users who are currently connected to the The Oracle server does not wait for the users 
		  who are currently connected to the database to disconnect.
		
		• The Oracle server rolls back active transactions and disconnects all connected users.
		
		• The Oracle server closes and dismounts the database before shutting down the instance.
		
		• The next startup does not require an instance recovery.
		
	-Connect with sys user and perform the following tasks...
	SQL> conn sys/sys123 as sysdba
	Connected.
	
	SQL> grant resource to a;

	Grant succeeded.

	SQL> grant create table to a;

	Grant succeeded.

	
	-Let's connect and create a new table to user a
	SQL> conn a/a;
	Connected.
	SQL> create table testtab(id number, name varchar2(50)) tablespace users;

	Table created.

	
	-insert data into testtab
begin

for i in 1..99999
	insert into testtab values(i,'Test Data...'||i);
end loop;
commit;
end;
/
	-now restart and connect with user a and check table data 
	SQL> startup

	SQL> conn a/a;
	Connected.
	SQL> select *from testtab;

	no rows selected
	
	-Note: Inserted data rolled back on immediate shutdown.	


	• T = TRANSACTIONAL:
		A transactional database shutdown proceeds with the following conditions:
		• No client can start a new transaction on this particular instance.
		
		• A client is disconnected when the client ends the transaction that is in progress.
		
		• When all transactions have been completed, a shutdown occurs immediately.
		
		• The next startup does not require an instance recovery

		-insert data into testtab with big amount
begin

for i in 1..999999
	insert into testtab values(i,'Test Data...'||i);
end loop;
commit;
end;
/

	-shutdown transactional
	SQL> shutdown transactional
	Database closed.
	Database dismounted.
	ORACLE instance shut down.

	
	
	-restart database
	
	SQL> startup
	ORACLE instance started.
