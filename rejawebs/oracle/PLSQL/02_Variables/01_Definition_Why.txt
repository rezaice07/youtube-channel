Variable:
---------
In PL/SQL, a variable is named storage location that stores a value of a particular data type.

PL/SQL Variable types:
----------------------
01. Scaler: stores a single value with one type. Also knonw as simple datatype.
02. Reference: Reference data types hold value which point to a storage location.
03. Larger Objects: is also know as LOBs. are also pointers to other data items that are stored outside of the table such as images, files, etc
04. Composite: These are generally known as collections or records


Datatype
-----------
	Scalar Datatypes:
		01. Char(size): if the size of char type is 30 bit, and assign data 10 bit into char type, will take maximun size of 30 bit even the stored data length is 30
		02. varchar2(size):this is the extended version of char. But in varchar2, 30 means the maximun len
		03. number(precision,scale): Precision value is 1 and 38 and scale is -84 and 127. if you have 18 and 2 means total 18 digits and 2 of them are the decimal parts.
		04. Binary_Integer=plsinteger: is faster than number when on arithmatic operation
		05. Binary_float: 
		06. BInary double:
		07. Bolean: in pl/sql is by default null
		08. Date: sysdate is default can be set
		09. Timestamp:More details
