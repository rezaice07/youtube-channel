Creating and Using Packages
-----------------------------

--Before creating a package, need to remember is that...
--one is package spec and another one is package body

--let's create package spec
create or replace PACKAGE EMPLOYEE_PKG
AS
  v_salary_increase_rate NUMBER :=0.15;
  CURSOR cur_emps
  IS
    SELECT *FROM employees;
  PROCEDURE increase_salaries;
  FUNCTION get_avg_sal(
      p_dept_id NUMBER)
    RETURN NUMBER;
END EMPLOYEE_PKG;

--and the package body is 
create or replace PACKAGE BODY EMPLOYEE_PKG
AS
  PROCEDURE increase_salaries
  AS
  BEGIN
    FOR item IN cur_emps
    LOOP
      UPDATE employees SET salary = salary+(salary*v_salary_increase_rate/100);
    END LOOP;
  END increase_salaries;
  FUNCTION get_avg_sal(
      p_dept_id NUMBER)
    RETURN NUMBER
  AS
  v_avg_sal number;
  BEGIN
   select avg(salary) into v_avg_sal from employees where DEPARTMENT_ID=p_dept_id;
   return v_avg_sal;
  END get_avg_sal;
END EMPLOYEE_PKG;

--how to we call this package items..
   
BEGIN
  EMPLOYEE_PKG.increase_salaries  ;  
END;

/
begin
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE( EMPLOYEE_PKG.get_avg_sal(90));
end;
